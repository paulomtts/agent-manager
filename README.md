# agent-manager

A local-first CLI that drives a `brd` milestone to completion by dispatching AI
harness instances (Claude Code, Codex, Pi) as subprocesses.

The program owns the dependency graph, the git mechanics, the gates, the retries
and the persistence. A harness is launched only for the steps that genuinely need
a model; everything else is plain Python.

See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-23-agent-manager-design.md` for the design.

## Usage

Drive one subtask card end to end. `--branch-prefix` is required — it is the
milestone prefix of the branch the run cuts — and `--verify` is repeatable, one
whole verification command per occurrence, run in the order given:

```bash
am run --card 19efcddc-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 \
  --branch-prefix m2 \
  --verify "uv run pytest" \
  --verify "uv run ruff check"
```

Pick a killed run back up at the phase it died in. There is no `--base-branch`
and no `--branch-prefix` here: both were decided when the run started and are
recorded on the run. The verification suite is not recorded, so a resume is told
it the same way a fresh run was:

```bash
am resume 20260923T140506Z-19efcddc --verify "uv run pytest"
```

Every command prints one line of JSON — `{"ok": true, "data": ...}` on success,
`{"ok": false, "error": {...}}` on a refusal. Add `--pretty` to indent it.

## Develop

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest
```
