"""Behaviour of the plan-check step (design §4 `steps/`, spec card d3feb87e).

Placement follows design §14: `plan_check.py` is a Steps component, so its
behaviour is exercised against real temporary directories and files created in
`tmp_path` -- no network, and no faking of the filesystem except where a test
must force an outcome a real filesystem will not produce on demand (an
unreadable file), exactly as the ported `plan-check.test.mjs` uses its `fakeFs`.
